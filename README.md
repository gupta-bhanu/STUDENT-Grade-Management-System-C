# Bhanu Grading System 🎓

A professional C-based academic record management tool designed for high-efficiency data entry and retrieval. This system was developed to demonstrate mastery of fundamental programming concepts and data structures.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Scalable Data Entry**: Define the exact number of student records at runtime, ensuring efficient memory usage.
- **Dual-Criterion Search Engine**: Instantly retrieve student details using either **Full Name** or **Registration Number** via advanced string comparison logic.
- **Automated Grade Analysis**: Features an integrated logic engine that assigns letter grades (O, A+, A, etc.) based on numerical scores.
- **Interactive UI**: A structured, menu-driven interface using Switch-Case logic for seamless navigation.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
This project serves as a practical application of the following engineering modules:
- **Control Flow & Logic**: Implementation of `switch-case` and nested `if-else` ladders for decision-making.
- **Data Storage**: Usage of **1D and 2D Arrays** to manage parallel datasets (Names, Roll Numbers, and Marks).
- **String Manipulation**: Mastery of `strcmp()` for robust database-style searching.



## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language**: C
- **Compiler**: GCC
- **Development Environment**: VS Code on ASUS TUF Gaming A16
